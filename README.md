## WHY EVERY PROGRAMMER SHOULD LEARN GAME DEVELOPMENT?

I found this read to be incredibly interesting! As someone who first got into coding through making small games in Python, I think a lot of what the article talks about holds true. While beginner game development doesn't go in-depth regarding the algorithms and structures, it is still a great introduction to computer science and programming. I also didn't really realize, until reading this article, how much you really learn just by creating what is considered "small and simple" games; especially since some of them can contain more advanced concepts like concurrency and multi-threading.

### Additional Responses

This article provides many solid reasons for a programmer to learn game devlopment, but I believe that most important of all game development brings a level of enjoyment for the programmer and serves as another window to for an individual who is interested in gaming to become interested in programming also.
