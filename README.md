## WHY EVERY PROGRAMMER SHOULD LEARN GAME DEVELOPMENT?

I found this read to be incredibly interesting! As someone who first got into coding through making small games in Python, I think a lot of what the article talks about holds true. While beginner game development doesn't go in-depth regarding the algorithms and structures, it is still a great introduction to computer science and programming. I also didn't really realize, until reading this article, how much you really learn just by creating what is considered "small and simple" games; especially since some of them can contain more advanced concepts like concurrency and multi-threading.

Wei Luo: Game is regarded as one of the latest art form in human history. With the improvement of graphics and user experiences, modern 3A video games could be the most complex software to be developed. Therefore, it requires software engineers with superior skills.
